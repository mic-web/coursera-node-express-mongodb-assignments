# Example solutions for assignments
Coursera provides a course "Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB" that's a good starting point for learning the ME(R)N stack.

This repository contains my solutions for all assignments. On top of that I added some tools that help during development (e.g. ESLint, Prettier).

If you're following the course as well and are looking for solutions I hope that I can help you if you're stuck with a problem or if you want to find out if there are better solutions.

# Topics involved
Following technologies had been evaluated and used with this tutorial:
* NodeJS
* Express
* MongoDB (NoSQL)
* Mongoose
* Authentication: compared JWT, OAuth2, Sessions and Basic
* Handling CORS
* File upload
* RESTful API

# Installation
To install all packages, just run `npm install`.

You should also install the Prettier in your IDE, as it helps you a lot with auto-formatting according to the linter rules.

# Run
Execute `npm start` to the example web server.

# Client application
An example client application that matches the REST API can be found here:

You will have to provide a matching setup (e.g. MongoDB database) to be able to try this out.
